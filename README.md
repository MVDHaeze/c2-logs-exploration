## What to do with Concept 2 logs (for indoor rowing)?

:heavy_exclamation_mark: **Clearly** overengineered when put into perspective with the size, complexity (or lack of), etc. of the dataset. I would have achieve the same result in Excel for a fraction of the time, but what's the fun in that? :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:

### What it does:

It takes seasonal CSV exports from the [c2 log website](https://log.concept2.com/), enrich the dataset (with a master calendar, new categories...) and display metrics about the season.

### Why to do that:

The c2 website offers minimal information or tool to deep dive into the logs. I wanted to understand more deeply my progression by focusing on trends instead of individual sessions.

### Likely future to dos:

- [ ] Directly fetch & update data from the c2 API (wich provides also more granular information for each session)
